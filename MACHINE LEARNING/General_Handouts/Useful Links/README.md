# Useful Links
Within this directory you will find child directories for various XCS classes, within each of these XCS class directories there is a README.md file that contains links to online resources which relate to the class materials. We categorise resources as follows:

* Research Papers ([example](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.04617))
* Code ([example](https://github.com/suraj-nair-1/lorel))
* Blog Posts ([example](https://ai.stanford.edu/blog/meta-exploration/))
* Talks/Presentations ([example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=733m6qBH-jI))
* Podcasts ([example](https://www.eye-on.ai/podcast-044))

The purpose of including these links is to help students navigate some of the available online materials that relate to the class content and to help instigate additional discussion of the class materials. We hope you find value in exploring the available links and we look forward to discussing their content with you.
